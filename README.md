### Hey 👋,

I'm Joshua, a junior at Singapore Management University pursuing a Bachelor's in Information Systems.

I'm passionate about all things software engineering with a deep interest in building large-scale distributed systems.

I have experience with full-stack development using a variety of programming languages and frameworks such as `TypeScript`, `Java`, `Python`, `React/Next.js`, `Node.js/Express.js` and `Spring Boot` I'm also picking up Swift to develop apps for iOS and visionOS 

Outside of work, I enjoy working out, reading and making a perfect cup of coffee ☕
